## What is Business Analytics?

Business analytics refers to the practice of using data, statistical analysis, and quantitative methods to gain insights into business operations and make informed decisions. It involves collecting, processing, and analyzing large volumes of data to identify patterns, trends, and correlations that can guide strategic planning and improve overall performance.

3. **Time Series Analysis**: Analyzing data points collected over time to identify patterns, trends, and seasonal variations.

4. **Decision Trees**: A visual representation of decision-making processes, helping to map out possible outcomes and their probabilities.

5. **Neural Networks**: Advanced machine learning models inspired by the human brain, capable of recognizing complex patterns in data.

## Applications of Business Analytics

Business analytics can be applied across various industries and departments within an organization:
