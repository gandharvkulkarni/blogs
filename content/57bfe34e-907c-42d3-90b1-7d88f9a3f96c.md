## Why Use an Excel Formulas PDF?

Excel is a powerful tool, packed with numerous functions that can automate calculations and manage data more efficiently. A well-structured Excel formulas PDF serves as a quick reference guide, allowing you to find the functions you need without sifting through menus or tabs.

Here are some key benefits of utilizing an Excel formulas PDF:

- **Offline Access**: You can keep a digital copy on your device or print it out for easy reference without needing internet access.

## Common Excel Formulas to Include in Your PDF

When creating or reviewing an Excel formulas PDF, it's crucial to include commonly used formulas that cater to various aspects of data handling and analysis:

- **SUM**: Adds all numbers in a range. Syntax: `=SUM(range)`
- **AVERAGE**: Calculates the average of a set of numbers. Syntax: `=AVERAGE(range)`
- **IF**: Checks a condition and returns specific values based on the result. Syntax: `=IF(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false)`
