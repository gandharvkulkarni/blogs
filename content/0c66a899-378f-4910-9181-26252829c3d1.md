# Introduction to SQL Window Functions

SQL window functions are powerful tools that allow you to perform complex calculations across a set of rows that are related to the current row. These functions operate on a window of data, hence the name "window functions." If you're looking to take your SQL skills to the next level, understanding window functions is crucial. In this blog post, we'll explore the basics of window functions and how they can revolutionize your data analysis capabilities.

## What Are Window Functions?

Window functions perform calculations across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row. They are similar to aggregate functions, but unlike aggregate functions, they don't cause rows to become grouped into a single output row. This allows you to maintain the individual rows while still performing calculations based on a group of rows.

## Types of Window Functions

There are several types of window functions, each serving different purposes:

1. Ranking functions: ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK()
2. Offset functions: LAG(), LEAD(), FIRST_VALUE(), LAST_VALUE()
3. Aggregate functions: SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MAX(), MIN()

These functions can be used with the OVER clause to define the window of rows on which the function operates.

## The OVER Clause

The OVER clause is a key component of window functions. It defines the window or set of rows on which the function operates. The OVER clause can contain three main components:

1. PARTITION BY: Divides the result set into partitions.
2. ORDER BY: Determines the order of rows within each partition.
3. ROWS or RANGE: Specifies the window frame.

## Example: Using ROW_NUMBER()

Let's start with a simple example using the ROW_NUMBER() function:

```sql
SELECT 
    employee_name,
    department,
    salary,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
FROM employees;
```

This query assigns a unique rank to each employee based on their salary, with the highest salary receiving rank 1.

## Partitioning Data with PARTITION BY

The PARTITION BY clause allows you to divide your data into groups. For example:

```sql
SELECT 
    employee_name,
    department,
    salary,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dept_salary_rank
FROM employees;
```

This query ranks employees' salaries within each department separately.

## Using Aggregate Functions as Window Functions

Aggregate functions can be used as window functions to perform calculations across a set of rows. For instance:

```sql
SELECT 
    employee_name,
    department,
    salary,
    AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) AS dept_avg_salary
FROM employees;
```

This query calculates the average salary for each department and displays it alongside each employee's information.

## Offset Functions: LAG() and LEAD()

LAG() and LEAD() functions allow you to access data from other rows in relation to the current row. For example:

```sql
SELECT 
    employee_name,
    hire_date,
    salary,
    LAG(salary) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) AS previous_salary
FROM employees;
```

This query shows each employee's current salary along with the salary of the previously hired employee.

## Advanced Window Frames

Window frames allow you to define a subset of rows within your partition. For example:

```sql
SELECT 
    employee_name,
    hire_date,
    salary,
    AVG(salary) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING) AS moving_avg_salary
FROM employees;
```

This query calculates a moving average of salaries based on the current row and one row before and after it.

## Conclusion

SQL window functions are incredibly powerful tools that can significantly enhance your data analysis capabilities. They allow you to perform complex calculations and comparisons across related rows while maintaining individual row integrity. By mastering window functions, you can gain deeper insights into your data and improve your SQL skills.
